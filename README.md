## ATM Mock Project
This is a task to show loops and functions, it mimicks an Automated teller machine with capabilities to open an account and also uses user details to login rather than the conventional card.

app.py is the main program, other files in the root directory are the logic used for the ATM mock.
Feel free to clone and open an account with us *wink* and test the app.
I would also love your feedback.

PS: This is a task for Zuri internship, happy to be part of it.
